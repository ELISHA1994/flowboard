# Phase 1: Enhanced Task Properties - Complete âœ…

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Priority System
- Added `TaskPriority` enum with levels: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT
- Tasks default to MEDIUM priority
- Priority filtering in task list endpoint
- Priority-based sorting option

### 2. Date Management
- **Due Date**: When the task should be completed
- **Start Date**: When work on the task can begin
- **Completed At**: Automatically set when task status changes to DONE
- Date validation: Due date must be after start date
- Date filtering: Filter tasks by due date ranges

### 3. Time Tracking
- **Estimated Hours**: Time estimate for task completion (0-1000 hours)
- **Actual Hours**: Time actually spent on task
- New endpoint `/tasks/{task_id}/time` to add time to tasks
- Time statistics in the dashboard

### 4. Task Positioning
- **Position** field for manual task ordering
- Endpoint `/tasks/{task_id}/position` to reorder tasks
- Automatic position assignment for new tasks

### 5. Enhanced Statistics
- New endpoint `/tasks/statistics/overview` provides:
  - Total tasks by status and priority
  - Overdue task count
  - Tasks due today/this week
  - Completed tasks this week
  - Total estimated vs actual hours

### 6. Specialized Endpoints
- `/tasks/overdue` - Get all overdue tasks
- `/tasks/upcoming?days=7` - Get tasks due in next N days
- Enhanced filtering on `/tasks/` endpoint

## Database Changes
- Migration script created: `migrations/001_add_task_enhancements.py`
- New columns added to tasks table:
  - priority (VARCHAR)
  - due_date (DATETIME)
  - start_date (DATETIME)
  - completed_at (DATETIME)
  - estimated_hours (REAL)
  - actual_hours (REAL)
  - position (INTEGER)

## API Examples

### Create Task with Priority and Dates
```bash
POST /tasks/
{
  "title": "Complete project documentation",
  "description": "Write comprehensive docs",
  "priority": "high",
  "due_date": "2025-07-25T17:00:00",
  "start_date": "2025-07-20T09:00:00",
  "estimated_hours": 8.5
}
```

### Add Time to Task
```bash
POST /tasks/{task_id}/time
{
  "hours_to_add": 2.5
}
```

### Filter Tasks
```bash
# By priority
GET /tasks/?priority=high

# By due date
GET /tasks/?due_before=2025-07-25T00:00:00

# Combined filters
GET /tasks/?priority=urgent&status=in_progress&sort_by=due_date
```

### Get Statistics
```bash
GET /tasks/statistics/overview

Response:
{
  "total": 25,
  "by_status": {
    "todo": 10,
    "in_progress": 8,
    "done": 7
  },
  "by_priority": {
    "low": 5,
    "medium": 12,
    "high": 6,
    "urgent": 2
  },
  "overdue": 3,
  "due_today": 2,
  "due_this_week": 8,
  "completed_this_week": 5,
  "total_estimated_hours": 120.5,
  "total_actual_hours": 98.0
}
```

## Test Coverage
- Created 46 new tests across unit and integration tests
- All tests passing (195 total tests)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing tasks

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Phase 2: Categories and Tags System
